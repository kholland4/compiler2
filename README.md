# compiler2
A compiler written in Python. Compiles from a C-like syntax to an assembly language written for this purpose. This can be assembled and run with assembler.py and run.py. Actual processor design coming soon.

This project is in the early stages and has limited functionality. A test program is included in code.txt, and an experimental shell (work in progress) is included in shell2.txt.

You will need to compile run.c to run.o; if you don't have a C compiler, you can use the much slower run.py.
